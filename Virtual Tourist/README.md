# Virtual Tourist

## Descriptions
Virtual tourist is an iOS application that can help users travel around the world virtually through a map. In this application, users can explore the world through a digital map, then can tap the desired location to view documentation of photos taken at that location. This photo is generated from the Flickr API which can be stored on the device so that the user can reopen a collection of photos that are in a certain selected location.. This project was created to fulfill a submission from Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree
