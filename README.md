# iOS Developer Nanodegree Program

## Descriptions

A Udacity NanodegreeÂ® Program is a unique online educational offering designed to bridge the gap between learning and career goals.

We partner with industry leaders and experts who understand what skills are in demand in the applicable job market. Students enroll in a specific course offering (e.g. Intro to Programming) and will be prompted to view the online course as well as complete a series of projects and support courses designed to help them develop job-relevant skills and build a portfolio to show prospective employers. Services related to the Nanodegree program may include classroom mentorship, moderated forums, and project reviews to ensure a personalized experience.
