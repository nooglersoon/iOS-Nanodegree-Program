# Meme Me

## Descriptions
Meme Me is an iOS application that has a function to easily create "memes" based on pictures we take or from photo albums. This application can configure the text in the created Memes and can be converted into images which can later be shared on social media or other platforms and saved to photo albums. This project was created to fulfill a submission from Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree
